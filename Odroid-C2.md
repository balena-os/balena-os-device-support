Will the Odroid-C2 be supported by resin.io? 
Please refer here http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G145457216438 for device's description.
I see that Odroid-C1+ and Odroid-XU3/XU4 is already supported, but since I develop my IoT projects on Odroid-C2 I need 
this kind of support.
