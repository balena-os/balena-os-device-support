To submit or suggest a new board, add a new issue to this repo and include the following in the ticket:

**CPU:** Add CPU or SoC info of the board, architecture, etc.

**GPU:** Add GPU info if relevant

**Memory:** Amount of onboard RAM the board has

**Storage:** Add storage options if relevant, for example some boards boot from eMMC

**Features:** Any additional features the board has.

**Link:** A URL to more info about the board

It would also be very useful to know if the board already has a yocto BSP layer.
